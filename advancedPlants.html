  <h3>Some of the hardest plants to grow: </h3>
  <p> 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Orchids</b> - needs just the right combination of humidity and watering to thrive.</li>
      <li><b>Maidenhair Fern</b> - a light mist, a humid climate, some time spent outside, a little splash of sunlight, this plant desires to be papmpered. </li>
      <li><b>Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree</b> - humidity, indirect sunlight, moist soil, infrequent waterings, these can all be life savers... and sometimes it decides to die anyways </li>
      <li><b>African Violets</b> - again! humidity. I have seen some people place this plant on an easy to care for list... any plant that requires that much humidity is hard to care for (unless, of couse, you actually live in the climate required for it.) </li>
      <li><b>String of Pearls Succulent</b> - most succulents are fairly forgiving, this one decides it doesn't like your face and dies to get away from you. This requires the opposite touch of the others in this list - ensure that the soil is <em>completely</em> dry before you water it again. </li>
      <li><b>Air Plant</b> - this plant grows in rock instead of soil, it should have a lot of indirect sunlight and be misted for watering depending on the humitidty in the room.</li>
      <li><b>Staghorn Fern</b> - I had not known this was a thing before I stumbled upon it in my reasearch. It is quite literally a plant that you hang on your wall like a deer head. Give it a thurough watering each week- let it dry before hanging it back on your wall (<i>so cool!</i>)</li>
      <li><b>Calathea</b> - high humidity and bright to indirect sun. Consider placing it with other plants.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>I have only cared for two of these plants: string of pearls and orchids. The orchid died when it was passed to my grandmother - and the string of pears decided it hated my face.</p>

  <p>It is important for many harder to take care of plants that you water on a schedule, and keep track of said schedule.</p>
  <p>Below is an example of my watering schedule for my succulents. I have long since forgotten many of their actual names and instead call them by their nicknames - some of which are friends of mine</p>
  <h4>Week of 09/06 watering schedule</h4>
